My first repository on GitHub, I'll just store ideas or trash.

Hello World!
Today is Thursday, 10/09/20.
I just started my way into coding, GitHub and all that. Started with logic using JavaScript as main language, got some highlights on HTML5 and CSS3 too. 
I've been using youtube for the starts and rocketseat.com.br to get some practice.
